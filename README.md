****************************************************************
Welcome to the "BECOME STAINLESS STEEL RAT" adventure!

That game is a text quest inspired by the Sci-fi series
"Stainless Steel Rat" by Harry Harrison. Majority of the content
used in the game is taken from the book 
"You can be the Stainless Steel Rat" and was further creatively
reworked.

Gameplay provides you with an opportunity to choose your own way
through the challenges and dangers of a distant planet. 
Each decision may affect the plot and different actions will have
different outcomes. So think carefully and do your best. 
Good luck adventurer, because you will need it!

Normally paced game might take you 1-3 hours to finish it,
but you can always try and replay it taking other decisions and
seeing what might have happened


****************************************************************
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

1.OS - Windows XP or higher
2.Mouse
3.Keyboard (for cheatcodes only)


****************************************************************
BEFORE STARTING

In order to work properly (and to start at all) game needs all
its files. That means you, under any circumstances, should not
delete anything from folder GameFiles or .exe file itself.
And deleting Saves folder might make you lose all your progress
so be careful.


****************************************************************
MAIN MENU

After starting a game and watching an intro you will get to the
main menu. From there several buttons are available to you:

NEW GAME - obviously begins a new game, giving you a fresh start.

LOAD GAME - allows you to continue your previous adventure if you
were prudent enough to save your game progress earlier. Button
is disabled if you have no saves yet.

CREDITS - gives you an info on soft used in production and the
creators of the game (that is being me and the book author)

HELP - Helps you conviniently read this text.

EXIT GAME - to stop being Stainless Steel Rat and temporarily get
back to your normal life.


****************************************************************
IN-GAME

After you started or loaded the game you will see a big text field
in the center of the screen. That's how you recieve all the
information in the game - you just read descriptions! Be mindful
of details - most of the time all the information necessary for
the win is provided there.

Below you will see several buttons proposing you to react in any
way to the situation described. Sometimes it is only one available
option, sometimes you have a choice, sometimes you are overwhelmed
by the amount of choices..

After you click the button you may read the outcome in the text
field and proceed like that to the very end. Happy ending,
hopefully.

In the top right corner you may see a button with a triple lines 
symbol. It is your access to Options menu, where you can make some
meaningful decisions like saving your game progress.

Finally if you are a cheater and want to use cheatcodes 
(which are activated from the Options Menu) you will have a small
red text field at the top of the screen. Just enter your code
there, press "Enter" on the keyboard and enjoy unjustly earned
success.


****************************************************************
OPTIONS

Options are available only from In-game and not the Main Menu.
When you click Options button in the top right corner of the screen
you will see a new window providing you with the opportunity to
choose from several options, each represented by a button:

RESUME GAME - gets you back to gameplay, when you are done with
the options.

SAVE - Saves your current state of adventure, so you can later
start from that same spot. Automatically closes Options window
afterwards so you can keep playing. Use it before quitting the
game and before taking important decisions. Just i case..

LOAD - Load previously saved game. Button only active if you have
any savesgames already. You will be presented with a choice of
all saved games you've created. For your convinience, you may see
date and time of the creation of each save and the preview of the
situation in game.
After choosing your save press the "Load" button to instantly get
there and continue playing, or press "Cancel" is you've changed 
your mind and it will take you back to the Options.

CHEATS ON/OFF - that button allows you to get (or lose) some fun
by traveling in time and space, appearing in the points of the plot
you haven't got to yet or getting back in time and replaying
something familiar to you. Attention - cheating may totally confuse
you since it tears the continuity of the game. You may get into
situations where you don't have a slightest clue about what's going
on!
That button represents current condition of the Cheats mode.
At first it will read "Cheats: OFF" meaning you cannot cheat. Press
it and it will become "Cheats: ON" so you know cheatcodes are
available to you. A small red text field will appear at the top of
the screen of main game window (In-game). Just enter your code
there, press "Enter" on the keyboard to confirm.
No, you will not be presented with the cheat codes - try to figure
it yourself! Well, OK-OK, I guess I can give you one of them.
Code 339 gets you to the very begining of your adventure, right to
the point where everything has started. But that's it, no more tips
on cheats.

HELP - Helps you conviniently read this text.

BACK TO MAIN MENU - gets you back to the Main Menu. Nuff said. 
Consider saving your game before doing so!

EXIT GAME - stop living a life of a secrat agent and get to 
whatever boring stuff you've done before installing that game.
